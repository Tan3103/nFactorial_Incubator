# Project Title: Spring Boot Application with Thymeleaf For nFactorial Incubator

## Introduction

This project is a Spring Boot web application that uses Thymeleaf as the template engine. The application is designed to demonstrate a simple yet effective way of building web applications with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the application on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Build the project using Maven:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Maven directory structure:

        └── com/
            └── example/
                └── demo/
                    └── DemoApplicationTests.java
```

## Design and Development Process

### Design

The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model:** Represents the data of the application. In this project, it includes entities such as `User`.
- **View:** Represents the UI of the application. Thymeleaf templates are used to render HTML pages.
- **Controller:** Handles the user input and updates the model and view accordingly. Controllers such as `HomeController` manage the request mappings.

### Development Methodologies

1. **Agile Methodology:**
   - The development process followed an agile methodology with iterative cycles, including planning, development, testing, and review phases.
   - Regular stand-ups and sprint reviews ensured continuous feedback and improvement.

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
   - Unit tests were written before the actual code to ensure the correctness of the functionalities from the start.

### Unique Approaches

- **Thymeleaf Integration:**
  - The project extensively uses Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of HTML templates.
  - This approach simplifies the process of passing data from the backend to the frontend, ensuring a smooth integration with Spring Boot.

## Compromises and Known Issues

### Compromises

1. **Simplified Security:**
   - The project uses a basic security setup for simplicity. For a production environment, a more robust security mechanism should be implemented.

2. **Database Selection:**
   - An H2 in-memory database is used for development and testing purposes. For production, consider using a more scalable and persistent database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

### Known Issues

1. **Error Handling:**
   - Current error handling is minimal and might not cover all edge cases. Comprehensive error handling should be added.

2. **Performance:**
   - The application is not optimized for high performance. Further profiling and optimization are recommended for handling larger user bases.

3. **User Interface:**
   - The UI is basic and may require further improvements to enhance user experience and responsiveness.
